# Web-Based Digital Democracy Application

# The basis of this project is to create a web-based system that allows for an election system to be utilised in an electronic/digital format. The election system will be designed
# in parallel to how the current, physically based UK election system functions. To this end, it will not support a customisable election system; it shall only function
# identically to the UK system.
